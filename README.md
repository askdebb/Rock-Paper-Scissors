## Anatomy (Flow chart)


## Challenges
Difficulties in using the same functions for different levels because each level had its unique behavior and it was not favorable to use the same functions to run the levels. This led to the creation of different script files for different levels by the use of module and import concepts to ensure some reusable components or functions that work the same across all levels.

The nature of the unique behavior of each level leads to employing different logic.




## Summary
This has been an interesting journey for me because I can programmatically display what happens in real events.
